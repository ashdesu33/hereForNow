The work consists of a translucent silk organza sheet with printed on text, suspended from a steel rod and chains. The silk organza, a fragile and fleeting material, echoes the intangibility of an imagined future—one filled with lessons, guidance, and experiences that now exist only as words. The text represents a monologue of care and knowledge that will never be spoken to its intended recipient. The steel elements—rod and chains—contrast with the delicacy of the silk, adding a structural weight that anchors the piece, symbolizing permanence, constraint, and the burden of memory through its inherent masculine qualities.

As the fabric sways subtly with air currents, the words shift in and out of clarity, reinforcing the impermanence of the envisioned relationship between mother and child. The installation invites contemplation on themes of loss, autonomy, potentiality, and the emotional weight of choice, transforming personal history into a poetic and tactile meditation on absence and imagined futures."

These forms can be used to create dynamic type in different scripts, cases, glyphs and other abstract forms. The 1-minute stencil generates more explicit forms and the 11-minute noodles make ambiguous and subjective letters. Using both stencils together creates Al-dente—a more suggestive typeface with qualities of both. The stencils are also a nod to handwriting’s fluidity, which is why there are multiple ways to create a single letter form. The stencil can be rotated, inverted, overlapped and untethered of typographic conventions, giving complete autonomy to the user. Much like cooking, it is intuitive and a tool for creating forms that celebrate play, chance, and unexpectedness."

Inspired by the power of fashion as both a tool and a statement, this zine delves into how Black style became an essential element of resistance, empowerment, and identity during a time of social and political upheaval.

Through an in-depth look at the Black Power Movement and the Black Ivy Revolution, Ivy Roots examines the cultural significance of fashion as a means of self-expression and defiance against systemic oppression. From the sharp suits of the Civil Rights leaders to the iconic afros, leather jackets, and berets of the Black Panthers, and the preppy yet rebellious attire of the Black Ivy League students, the zine highlights how style was intricately woven into the fabric of revolution.

Ivy Roots also highlights the attire of the everyday individual, showing how daily fashion choices became acts of resistance and cultural pride. It bridges the past and present, tracing the evolution of Black style from the 1960s to the modern era, raising thought-provoking questions about what Black style is and how it continues to shape and be shaped by cultural and political movements today.

This zine invites readers to reflect on the enduring legacy of Black fashion and its role in challenging the status quo, celebrating heritage, and inspiring future generations."

Each poster explores the tension between perception and reality through different lenses: psychology, science, and philosophy. The first poster examines human nature with the phrase “I’m not a bad dog // I don’t know why I bite,” reflecting the struggle between inherited tendencies and self-determination. The second poster uses optical illusions to highlight how our physiology both constructs and distorts perception. The final poster, referencing Magritte’s The ""Treachery of Images"" with “Ceci n’est pas un paysage” (“This is not a landscape”), questions whether representations can ever truly embody what they depict. Through this interplay, ""Mirer"" challenges us not just to observe but interrogate the lenses through which we perceive reality."

Weaving the Soul,"Korean paper, Wood",7.5 x 7.5 in,Minnie Lee,2023,Weaving the Soul_Minnie Lee_1.png,src/Weaving the Soul_Minnie Lee_1.png,Downloaded: Weaving the Soul_Minnie Lee_1.png,"A bookmark is a momentary pause, a trace left between pages—a marker of presence before the journey resumes. In Weaving the Soul, the artist interlaces history and personal interpretation, transforming traditional Korean palace patterns into a contemporary 2D design. Inspired by the intricate drawings and motifs of royal architecture, she weaves these elements into her own visual language, embracing an antique yet timeless color palette. Each pattern is a thread connecting past and present, tradition and reinvention, delicately crafted to carry the echoes of cultural memory.

Like the act of reading itself, this bookmark invites engagement with the ephemeral: it holds a place, only to be moved again. In this way, the artwork echoes the fleeting nature of existence—seen, touched, then gone—reminding us that every moment leaves a trace, however slight, however fleeting.
